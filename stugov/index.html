            Hello, my name is Max Kerzner, and I am running to be your student government representative because I believe I can make school less stressful and more enjoyable. Currently, the test calendar leaves out essays and quizzes, leaving many of us with way too many assignments in one day. I once had a research paper due the same day as a Spanish quiz, a math test, and a chemistry test. I want to fix that by ensuring all assignments are included on the calendar, allowing students to control their destiny. I also want to improve the house system. Right now, it feels like nobody cares. I will push for real rewards such as a Chipotle lunch day or a get out of homework free pass. With me, you get the aforementioned improvements and more. The school right now is giving you the minimum, and it's up to you to vote for the Max.
